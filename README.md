# jaslone1.github.io

user input searches theaudioDB for artist info and album information for discography
an artist banner shows up on top of the page
two artist pics and a bio can be scrolled through in a carousel
discography pops up upon clicking a button

the css does not allow for the the pop-up to takeup the whole page and discography does not show in a ul form
the placeholder for the carousel does not disappear, but I could not get it to disappear without either an extra image being shown or no image starting in the div.
multiple searches append more discography buttons
